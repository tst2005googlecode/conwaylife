This is a Lua implementation of Conway's Game of Life:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

I tested it with the patterns (collection name - jslife) from this page:

You can see the animation by running main.lua using Love2d:

Here's a sample call to start the animation:
software\lua\love-0.7.0-win-x86\love.exe Code\Eclipse\sgeorge\Lua\conwaylife
